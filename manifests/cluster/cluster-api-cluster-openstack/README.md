# Cluster API Core

This is typically installed with `clusterctl generate cluster`.
Upon further inspection, this just installs directly from GitHub.
Grab the definition with:

```sh
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/releases/download/v0.6.3/cluster-template.yaml -O manifest.yaml
```
